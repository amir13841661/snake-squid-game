the idea of the game:to be done.















key features:
1.obstacles
2.backtracking
3.move limit
4.lives







obstacles:based on the difficulity there are randomized obstacles all around the grid
should a player hit one of the obstacles they'll backtrack to their last position and
get a time penalty.

backtracking:as mentioned above backtracking can happen in two ways:
1.should the user hit an obstacle they will backtrack to their last position.
2.if the user has lost one of their lives.

move limit:the user is limited to a certain amount of moves their number of moves cannot exceed 
this limit or they will lose.

lives:there are harts scattered all around the grid if the user picked one of them up they would gain 
an extra life.
